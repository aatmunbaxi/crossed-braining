A subset \( \Delta \) of a [[id:b23950d7-a56d-4745-aed3-ceb2f6e79c90][root system]] \( R \) is called a *base* if
- \( \Delta \) is a basis of \( R \)
- each root has a unique representation \( \beta = \sum_{\alpha\in \Delta}^{} k_{\alpha} \alpha \) with integral coefficients *that are either all nonnegative or all nonpositive*.

Root bases are constructed with respect to a particular [[id:bab72310-31d5-4f2d-9075-e5ca701df8e6][Weyl chamber]], in fact they are in 1-1 correspondence with Weyl chambers.
