Varieties are arguably the central objext of study in algebraic geometry.
They put just enough requirements on schemes for them to be nicely behaved.
You can check that the classical notion of varieties (zero sets of polynomials) agree with this definition.

* Definition
A /variety/ is a reduced (no nilpotents), separated (diagonal map is closed embedding) [[id:436eeda5-0fcf-4741-b906-fcb50805de8d][scheme]] of finite type (finite covering by finitely generated algebras).
