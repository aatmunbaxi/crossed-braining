In practice, [[id:252ba56b-1457-4d9d-abe0-3453b148aa43][sheaf cohomology]] is impossible compute via [[id:58a49504-b4d6-47bc-8261-066ff8373341][right derived functor]]s. We can approximate sheaf cohomology with [[id:e0644a26-887c-411c-b1e3-32fa53f73502][Cech cohomology]] with respect to a good enough cover. This will yield isomorphisms in degree \( 0,1 \), with maps in higher degrees that might not be isomorphisms.
The theorem of Leray says that if the sheaf \( \mathcal{F} \) is acyclic (i.e. cohomology in \( p >0 \) vanishes on every finite intersection of the cover \( \mathcal{U} \)), then \( \overline{H}^p( \mathcal{U}, \mathcal{F} ) = H^p (X , \mathcal{F}) \).
