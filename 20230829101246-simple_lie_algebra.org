A [[id:04c2e796-c1db-4e7b-8317-6409312fcba6][Lie algebra]] is /simple/ if it is not abelian and has no nontrivial ideals.

Note that \( [LL] \) being an ideal implies immediately that \( [LL]=L \) when \( L \) is simple.

- Since \( \ker \operatorname{ad} = Z( \mathfrak{g} ) \), and the center is an ideal, \( \operatorname{ad} \) the [[id:bb4fb805-cba4-465c-9b64-147d4fbe9416][adjoint representation]] is injective.
