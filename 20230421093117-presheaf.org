A presheaf is an assignment of some /local data/ to a space in a way that restrictions from larger localities to smaller localities make sense.
Here "local" refers to some open subset.

* Definition
A presheaf with values in a category \(\mathsf{C}\) on a topological space \( X \) is a contravariant functor \( \mathcal{F} : X^{\mathrm{op}}\to \mathsf{C} \)

- Most often, \( \mathsf{C}= \mathsf{Set} \), where the sets have some other structure that lets us understand them beyong just being sets, such as abelian groups, modules, rings, etc.
