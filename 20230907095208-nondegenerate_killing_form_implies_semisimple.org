The Killing form of a [[id:04c2e796-c1db-4e7b-8317-6409312fcba6][Lie algebra]] \( \mathfrak{g}  \) is nondegenerate (i.e. its radical \( S = \left\{ x\in \mathfrak{g} \mid \kappa(x,y)=0\,\, \forall y\in \mathfrak{g}  \right\} \) is zero) *if and only if* \( \mathfrak{g}  \) is semisimple.

The proof is outlined.
\( \operatorname{Rad}(\kappa) \) is solvable by Cartan's criterion.

This theorem supplies a computational way to check semisimplicity as opposed to searching for abelian ideals or other methods.
