A *near group category* is a [[id:59cc4766-c370-4c41-8541-d40d1c09c13d][fusion category]] such that all but one of the simple objects is invertible.
They were introduced in [[id:35e239fa-ff49-4e5f-bdcd-1e875c38ffe7][Siehler, J.: Near-Group Categories]].

The invertible simple objects form a group \( G \), with semisimplicity of the objects implying that the noninvertible object \( X' \) satisfies \( X' \otimes  X' \cong \bigoplus_{g\in G}^{} g \oplus kX' \) for some \( k \geqslant 0 \).
The data \( (G,k) \) is called the *near group fusion rule*.
