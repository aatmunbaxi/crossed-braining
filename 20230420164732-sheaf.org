* Definition
A sheaf \( \mathcal{F}  \) on a space \( X \) is a [[id:179710fe-efb8-48ac-ab8c-3fc9f48f479f][presheaf]] that satisfies the extra coherence condition that on an open cover \( \left\{ U_i \right\} \), the diagram
\begin{equation}
F(U) \to \prod_{i}^{} F(U_i) \rightrightarrows \prod_{i,j}^{} F(U_i\cap U_j)
\end{equation}
is a equalizer.

Intuitively, [[id:d1387254-6252-474a-a117-f1cd1db28bd5][sheaves are rules to glue local data]] into global data.
+ They are NOT determined by their stalks in general
+ Sheaf morphisms satisfy coherence with the restrictions
  + Kernels of morphisms are sheaves, but images and quotients are not in general, you need the [[id:2c6d0c7f-7800-4dac-a3b4-a3581897f0b1][sheafification]] for this
** Examples
- The structure sheaf on a [[id:4e5b708b-ee01-431f-a594-3c367a00d88d][variety]]  \( X \) takes open sets \( U \mapsto \mathcal{O}(U) \) where \( \mathcal{O}(U) \) consists of fractions \( a/b \) with \( b(x)\neq 0 \) on \( U \)
- The constant sheaf takes every open set to some chosen set
  - This one seems silly but is actually important, the de Rham cohomology of a manifold is the [[id:e0644a26-887c-411c-b1e3-32fa53f73502][Cech cohomology]] of the constant sheaf \( \underline{\mathbf{R}} \to M \)
