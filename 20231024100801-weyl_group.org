The *Weyl group* associated to a [[id:b23950d7-a56d-4745-aed3-ceb2f6e79c90][root system]] \( \Phi \) is the subgroup of \( \operatorname{GL}(E) \) generated by the set of reflections \( \sigma_{\alpha}(v) = v - \left\langle v,\alpha \right\rangle \alpha\).

* Properties
- It is finite, since \( \sigma_{\alpha} \) leaves \( \Phi \) invariant, which is a finite set, so we can identify it with a subgroup of the symmetric group of the root system, which is finite.
