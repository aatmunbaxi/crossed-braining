A [[id:04c2e796-c1db-4e7b-8317-6409312fcba6][Lie algebra]] is *solvable* if the derived series stabilizes at \( 0 \) in finite length.

The usual properties of solvability hold: namely subalgebras as solvable, homomorphic images are solvable, and if \( \mathfrak{a}  \subset \mathfrak{g}  \) is an ideal and is solvable, and \( \mathfrak{g}  / \mathfrak{a}  \) is solvable, then \( \mathfrak{g}  \) is solvable.
