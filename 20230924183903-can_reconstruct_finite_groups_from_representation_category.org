By [[id:c6d01322-4337-4cff-b5ce-9f46a301f4c7][Tannaka duality]], one can determine a finite group up to isomorphism by considering its [[id:7fc90d0d-1696-4fcb-88b4-48007536481c][symmetric monoidal category]] of finite dimensional [[id:92e8eb74-fedc-4920-ad97-97b06201a693][representations]].

Interestingly, when one drops the symmetric structure, the theorem is false.
Groups whose representations produce the same monoidal category are called *isocategorical* and are studied in [[id:9069d6e9-04ea-4ea2-98b6-33b415d7f714][Isocategorical Groups]].
