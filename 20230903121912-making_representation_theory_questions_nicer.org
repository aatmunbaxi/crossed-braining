The goal of [[id:32ef7b6a-2143-4b73-acf5-e2f2ee309e62][representation theory]] is to turn hard problems into nicer linear algebra problems.

Sometimes the structures we're taking representations of don't have nice enough representation theory.
The birth of objects like [[id:af2adb9a-7a55-4d21-9169-d2e675ec6ff2][universal enveloping algebras]] and [[id:ca8cf6a8-55d1-4c2f-816e-dcb04c073682][Hopf algebras]] are partly motivated by the goal of making the representation theory nicer.
The former has [[id:04c2e796-c1db-4e7b-8317-6409312fcba6][Lie algebras]] as their source and the latter as [[id:0273392f-6ba4-44aa-912f-ff0d5221ae3a][group algebras]] as their source.
