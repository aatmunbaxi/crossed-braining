It is a result that for a [[id:04c2e796-c1db-4e7b-8317-6409312fcba6][Lie algebra]] \( \mathfrak{g}  \), if \( \mathfrak{g}  / Z(\mathfrak{g} ) \) is nilpotent, then \( \mathfrak{g}  \) is.

*However*, it cannot avoid nilpotency by triviality: if \( \mathfrak{g}  \) is nonzero and nilpotent, then \( Z(\mathfrak{g} )\neq 0 \).
