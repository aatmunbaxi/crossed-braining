Locally free sheaves on a topological space.
Explicitly, a total space \( E \) and projection \( p : E \to X \) such that \( p ^{-1}(x) := E_x \) is a vector space of some dimension (called the /rank/ of the bundle).
Also require that there is a triviailizing cover \( \left\{ U_i \right\} \) of \( X \) such that \( E_{U_i} \cong U_{i} \times k^n \).

- [[id:393d2a88-d753-4dca-b2b7-fd5789af84e6][coherent sheaves generalize vector bundles]].
- Rank 1 vector bundles (called "line bundles") on \( \mathbb{P}V \) correspond to linear equivalence classes of Cartier divisors
