The *Grothendieck ring* of a [[id:59cc4766-c370-4c41-8541-d40d1c09c13d][fusion category]] is the free ring generated by the category's simple objects, with product induced by the tensor product ([[id:7fc90d0d-1696-4fcb-88b4-48007536481c][monoidal category]]) of the category and addition induced by the direct sum of object.
It is denoted \( \operatorname{Gr}( \mathcal{C}) \) for a category \( \mathcal{C} \).

The Grothendieck ring of a fusion category is a [[id:78f1307e-2b02-4ce9-a696-815d8899577b][fusion ring]], with involution of \( \mathbf{Z}_{+} \)-basis given by the rigidity of the category.
