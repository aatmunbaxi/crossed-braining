[[id:6210ca24-5d50-4752-8834-9b9a6c82e24b][sheaves]] are tools that give a systematic and repeatable set of rules with which we can "glue" local data into global data.
The underlying [[id:179710fe-efb8-48ac-ab8c-3fc9f48f479f][presheaf]] of a sheaf is the assignment of local data (in whichever category it takes values in) to each open set of the space.
The extra conditions to make it a sheaf are the 'rules'.
Sheaf-ness is a *property* of an assignment of local data, and *not* a structure.
