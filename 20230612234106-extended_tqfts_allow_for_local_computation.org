One advantage of the [[id:dbdab25c-644a-4c8b-8ad0-cda00143dbf7][Atiyah-Segal]] definition of TQFT is that they are simple and slick to define.
Unfortunately, the only information afforded is in codimension \( 1 \), since the \( (d-1) \)-manifolds at the end of the cobordism are without boundary.

The notion of [[id:da243947-bb13-4aad-962d-5557898c7338][fully extended TQFTs]], making use of [[id:1c9d6cc8-8ba2-4c57-9b71-e9a97ffd7146][extended cobordisms]] allow one to cut along arbitrary manifolds and glean information at this level.
This makes computation of local data possible.
