The *extended cobordism category* \( \mathsf{Cob}_k(n) \) has as objects closed oriented \( (n-k) \)-manifolds, 1-morphisms are bordisms \( \partial B \cong \overline{M}\sqcup N \) up to diffeomorphism.
Given two \( B,B' : M \to N \) bordisms, a 2-morphism \( B \Rightarrow B' \) is a bordism between them that is trivial along the boundary.
Proceed like this inductively, then finally \( k \)-morphisms are \( n \)-manifolds \( X \) with corners, with \( \partial X \) defined by source and target, up to diffeomorphism relative to the boundaries.
Morphism composition at all levels is done by concatenation.
